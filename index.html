        <p> My name is Mark i grew up in a small town in Alberta. I grew up playing hockey and soccer. I have been very
            facinated with computers for a long time, ive wanted to learn how to make things online and thats why ive
            gone into web development. Going into these classes i new very little about web defvelopment however i tend
            to finf myself watching youtube videos on how to do it, and with solving small problems i run into. So far i
            have really enjoyed this and i look forward into what we do next. </p>
