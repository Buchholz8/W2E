        <h3> French Enter Spain</h3>
        <p>The Peninsular War (1807â€“1814) was the military conflict fought in the Iberian Peninsula by Spain, Portugal,
            and the United Kingdom against the invading and occupying forces of the First French Empire during the
            Napoleonic Wars. In Spain, it is considered to overlap with the Spanish War of Independence.[d] The war
            started when the French and Spanish armies invaded and occupied Portugal in 1807 by transiting through
            Spain, and it escalated in 1808 after Napoleonic France occupied Spain, which had been its ally.</p>
        <h3>Birth of Guerrilla warfare</h3>
        <p>he guerrilla style of fighting was the Spanish military's single most effective tactic. Most organized
            attempts by regular Spanish forces to take on the French ended in defeat. Once a battle was lost and the
            soldiers reverted to their guerrilla roles, they tied down large numbers of French troops over a wide area
            with a much lower expenditure of men, energy, and supplies[citation needed][101] and facilitated the
            conventional victories of Wellington and his Anglo-Portuguese army and the subsequent liberation of Portugal
            and Spain.[103] Mass resistance by the people of Spain inspired the war efforts of Austria, Russia and
            Prussia against Napoleon.[104]</p>
        <h3>End of French occupation</h3>
        <p>In August 1813, British headquarters still had misgivings about the eastern powers moving into France.
            Austria had now joined the Allies, but the Allied armies had suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of
            Dresden. They had recovered somewhat, but the situation was still precarious. Wellington's brother-in-law
            Edward Pakenham wrote, "I should think that much must depend upon proceedings in the north: I begin to
            apprehend ... that Boney may avail himself of the jealousy of the Allies to the material injury of the
            cause."[148] But the defeat or defection of Austria, Russia and Prussia was not the only danger. It was also
            uncertain that Wellington could continue to count on Spanish support.[149]</p>
